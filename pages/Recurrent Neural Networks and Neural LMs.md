alias:: 递归神经网络和神经语言模型

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Train with SGD and Backpropagation through Time
- RNN extensions: Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- RNN extensions: Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Language modelling: return sentence probabilities as well as representations
- Text classification: learn contextualised word representations and use them to predict a given class
