- The first problem of modeling: Language Modeling
- Assign a label to each word in a sequence
	- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
		- Usage
			- text classification
			- language modelling
			- syntactic parsing
			- named entity recognition
			- question answering
		- Most used tag set [Penn Treebank P.O.S. Tags (upenn.edu)](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)
			- Also we can use [Universal POS tags (universaldependencies.org)](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/)
	- Named Entity Recognition
	- Machine Translation (reconstruct word alignments)
- Sequence labelling
