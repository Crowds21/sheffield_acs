	- 输入是一个序列（任意序列）
	- 输出也是一个序列（同样是任意序列，但对于我们的目标来说，这是文本）
- Demonstrating Task Neural Machine Translation (任务型神经机器翻译)
	- What is Machine Translation? [[card]]
		- Machine Translation (MT) consists of translating a sentence $x$ from one language (the source) to a sentence $y$ in another language (the target)
	- What is Neural Machine Translation Model? [[card]]
		- Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is Machine Translation using neural networks (as opposed to alignment and phrase based translation).
		- Typically we use sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq).
		- These models are end-to-end differentiable
