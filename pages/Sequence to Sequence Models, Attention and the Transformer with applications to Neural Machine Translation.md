	- 输入是一个序列（任意序列）
	- 输出也是一个序列（同样是任意序列，但对于我们的目标来说，这是文本）
- Demonstrating Task Neural Machine Translation (任务型神经机器翻译)
	- What is Machine Translation? [[card]]
		- Machine Translation (MT) consists of translating a sentence $x$ from one language (the source) to a sentence $y$ in another language (the target)
	- What is Neural Machine Translation Model? [[card]]
		- Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is Machine Translation using neural networks (as opposed to alignment and phrase based translation).
		- Typically we use sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq).
		- These models are end-to-end differentiable
	- Task Formulation
		- Example: We want to translate from English to Spanish
			- We want to find best Spanish sentence $y$, given English sentence  $x$

			- Generate sentences using a neutral network (seq2seq)
			- We are going to teach the neural network to generate candidate sentences
		- How do we search through this large list of possible sentences?
			- Beam Search
		- $$
		  y^{\prime}=\arg \max _y p(y \mid x, \theta)
		  $$
			- p -> model
			- $\theta$ -> parameters
