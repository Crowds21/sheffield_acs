	- Natural languages (unlike programming languages) are not designed; they evolve
		- new words appear constantly
		- syntactic rules are flexible
		- ambiguity is inherent
	- world knowledge is necessary for interpretation
	- many languages, dialects, styles
- Challenges in Traditional rule-based artificial intelligenc and Learning from data (machine learning) adapts [[card]]
	- Rule-based
		- requires expert knowledge to engineer the rules not flexible to adapt in multiple languages, domains, applications
