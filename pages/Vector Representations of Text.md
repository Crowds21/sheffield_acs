	  ref:: ((63dfa07c-7f26-4748-9b6e-83e438c17179))
	  collapsed:: true
		- Natural languages (unlike programming languages) are not designed; they evolve
			- new words appear constantly
			- syntactic rules are flexible
			- ambiguity is inherent
		- world knowledge is necessary for interpretation
		- many languages, dialects, styles
	- Challenges in Traditional rule-based artificial intelligenc and Learning from data (machine learning) adapts [[card]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Rule-based
			- requires expert knowledge to engineer the rules
			- not flexible to adapt in multiple languages, domains, applications
		- Machine leanring
			- to evolution: just learn from new data
			- to different applications: just learn with the appropriate target representation
