- Make your design is easy to understand
  collapsed:: true
	- Research found
		- Developers spend ~60% of their time on “program comprehension”.
		- A further ~25% of their time is spent on navigation.
	- ((6405ed49-b8dd-424e-adee-684137fb6217))
		- Save time to understanding what is already there
		- Reduces risk of misunderstandings
	- Modularity 模块化
- Good Modularity
	- Coupling 耦合
		- “Tightly coupled” if there are lots of calls or data-accesses across file / module boundaries.
		- Loose coupling encouraged by encapsulation - good use of public interfaces.
	- Cohesion 内聚
		- A single file or module is “cohesive” if the code within it is highly interdependent.
	- 目标: 高内聚,低耦合
- Class / Module Size
