	- What is a language model? 
	  Describe the data required to train a language model
	  and what a trained model is expected to return
		- Language model is
		- The data: Train set, test set, validation set. Pre-annotated text.
		- They are expected to return the probability of an unseen sentence x.
	- What is the equation for the probability of a sentence?
	  How is this probability approximated in an n-gram language model?
	  Explain the equation and the approximation terms.
	- What is add-1 smoothing? 
	  Why is it important for language modelling? 
	  Describe using equations how add-1 smoothing is applied to the bigram language model.
