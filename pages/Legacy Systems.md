- View points
	- Context
	  collapsed:: true
		- Describes the relationships, dependencies, and interactions between the system and its environment.
	- Functional
	  collapsed:: true
		- Functional elements, their responsibilities and interactions. Traditionally the starting point for an architectural description.
	- Information
	  collapsed:: true
		- How the architecture stores, manipulates, manages and distributes information. Content, structure, ownership, latency,  etc.
	- Concurrency
	  collapsed:: true
		- Maps functional elements to concurrency units to clearly identify which parts of the system are synchronous or asynchronous.
	- Development
	  collapsed:: true
		- How does the architecture support development - building, testing, maintaining, and enhancing the system.
	- Deployment
	  collapsed:: true
		- What environment will the system be deployed to? Dependencies on the runtime environment, network connections, etc.
	- Operational
	  collapsed:: true
		- How the system will be operated, administered, et
- Perspectives
	- Accessibility
		- The ability of the system to be used by people with disabilities
	- Availability & Resilience
		- Ability to be operational as and when required, and to handle failures that could affect availability.
	- Development Resource
		- Ability to be designed, build, deployed, and operated within constraints around people, budget,  time, materials.
	- Evolution
		- Ability to be flexible in the face of inevitable change, balanced against costs of providing this  flexibility.
	- Internationalisation
		- Ability to be independent from any particular language, country or cultural group.
	- Location
		- Ability to overcome problems brought about by the location of its elements and distances between  them.
	- Performance & Scalability
		- Ability to predictably execute within mandated performance profile, and handle increasing volumes.
	- Regulation
		- Ability to conform to local and international laws, quasi-legal regulations, company policies, etc.
	- Security
		- Ability to reliably control, monitor, and audit who can perform what mechanisms on what resources.
	- Usability
		- Ease with which people can interact with the system and work effectively.
