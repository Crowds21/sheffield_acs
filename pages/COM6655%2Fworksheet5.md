		- 检查 odd value 并不是 reasonable care
			- ((6358f985-305d-434f-82dc-64d36032a440)) 中规定需要有 reasonable care
			- checking the calculations was impractical given the time schedule
			- therefore they were unable to exercise the required “reasonable” standard of care

- Contract law
  collapsed:: true
	- Property developer
	  collapsed:: true
		- -> sue the engineers
			- ==Contract:== will be employed under a contract by the property developer.
			- they have failed to exercise due care
		- x-> cannot sue the software developer
			- 他们之间不存在合同 (Privity of contract.)
	- The engineers
	  collapsed:: true
		- -> sue the software developers
			- ==Contract:== The software used by the engineer will be licensed or bespoke.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Consumer Rights Act 2015  is available for both kinds of software
			- they have failed to exercise a reasonable level of care and skill (bespoke)
				- ((6358f985-305d-434f-82dc-64d36032a440))
				- the courts will decide whether the developers have exercised reasonable care
			- the software was not fit for its intended purpose (licensed).

		- The engineers
			- the negligence of engineers
			- the engineers were using a new type of alloy
			- both favour the software developer

			- failing to exercise due care when supplying rules for the expert system
	- The families of the dead
	  collapsed:: true

- Negligence
  collapsed:: true
	- The families of the dead workmen
		- must sue the engineer and property developer by negligenc
	- The engineer
		- may sue the software developer in negligence.
		- damages would be reduced because of the contributory negligence of the engineer.

	- 软件开发商不能用疏忽起诉系统专家,因为他是不知道,不是说疏忽
- Negligent misstatement
  collapsed:: true
	- The engineer
		- may have an action in negligent misstatement against the programmers, expert and knowledge engineers for the provision of incorrect advice.
	- The software developer
		- could claim that the engineer should be qualified to use the system
			- and was ==negligent by failing to spot errors== in the output of the system.
		- may have included a disclaimer with the software exempting liability for defective advice from the system.
- Product Liability
	- Whether the [[Consumer Protection Act]] applies is unclear – whether they supplied a complete system of which software was a part.
	- Seems that only software was traded, so the [[CPA]] does not apply.
	- If it did, the software would be defective if its safety is not what one is entitled to expect.
	- Mitigating circumstances would be a disclaimer with the software, and whether the software was being used for an inappropriate task.
	- Note that the software developer boasted that its product was “the most reliable on the market” so the engineer would be justified in expecting a high standard of safety.
