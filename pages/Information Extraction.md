- What is Information Extraction (IE)?
	- a practically-motivated engineering discipline (models not necessarily inspired by nature)
	- the extraction of structured information from unstructured (= textual) sources.
	- its significance is connected to the growing amount of information in text and its potential use in systems (e.g. question answering)

	- > Text Classification Example
	- Feature extraction/engineering:
		- using domain knowledge to extract features from data.
	- Feature:
		- a piece of evidence intended to help the classifier map the input to the right target class
	- Feature vector:
		- a vector $\vec{F}$ , the components $F_j=\phi_j\left(d_j\right)$ , of which are
		  results applying a feature function to the data point $d_j$.
	- Example: “Spam vrs Ham” email?
		- number of “!” included in email body
		- length of the email in characters
		- occurrence of the word “cash” in the title or body.

	- Feature learning
		- automatically extract features from data - replaces manual feature engineering that is prone to human errors.

	- Rule-based:
		- Human experts (computational linguists) write general linguistic rules and task-specific extraction rules.
		- Example, trigger keywords, regular expressions and patterns.
		- Rule-based rules are language dependent, suffer from human ingenuity, time consuming, difficult to adapt to changes.
