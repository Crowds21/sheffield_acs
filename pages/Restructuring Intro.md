	- Plan Measure Operate Deploy Release Test Build Code
- Learning objectives
	- To learn frequent reengineering problems and solutions as “patterns”.
	- To understand the objectives and tradeoffs for individual reengineering patterns.
	- To restructure legacy software with educated decisions.
- Patterns
	- Book: A Pattern Language
	- Architect Christopher Alexander and his colleagues ==introduced patterns as a literary==  form in his book.
	- They present a systematic method for ==architecting various physical structures==, from rooms to buildings and towns.
	- Reengineering patterns
		- Let us discuss recurring issues and tradeoffs in reengineering legacy systems.
		- Help in diagnosing problems, identifying weaknesses, and finding solutions.
	- Different between reengineering and refactoring
		- Refactoring is a technique to resolve specific reengineering patterns.
		- Reengineering patterns entail more than refactoring (e.g., test automation).
